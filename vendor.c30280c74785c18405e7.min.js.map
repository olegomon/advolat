Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>\n * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);\n * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);\n * var result = Rx.Observable.concat(timer, sequence);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in:\n * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Concatenate an array of 3 Observables</caption>\n * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);\n * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);\n * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);\n * var result = Rx.Observable.concat([timer1, timer2, timer3]); // note that array is passed\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in the following:\n * // (Prints to console sequentially)\n * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9\n * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5\n * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it</caption>\n * const timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(2);\n *\n * Rx.Observable.concat(timer, timer) // concating the same Observable!\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // \"...and it is done!\" also after 4s\n *\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link concatMapTo}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} input1 An input Observable to concatenate with

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10);

For example:\n *\n * ```html\n *  <link rel=\"import\" href=\"/bower_components/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/effects/waterfall.html\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Consuming effects\n *\n * Effects can be consumed via the `effects` property. For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"></app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Creating scroll effects\n *\n * You may want to create a custom scroll effect if you need to modify the CSS of an element\n * based on the scroll position.\n *\n * A scroll effect definition is an object with `setUp()`, `tearDown()` and `run()` functions.\n *\n * To register the effect, you can use `Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect(effectName, effectDef)`\n * For example, let's define an effect that resizes the header's logo:\n *\n * ```js\n * Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect('resizable-logo', {\n *   setUp: function(config) {\n *     // the effect's config is passed to the setUp.\n *     this._fxResizeLogo = { logo: Polymer.dom(this).querySelector('[logo]') };\n *   },\n *\n *   run: function(progress) {\n *      // the progress of the effect\n *      this.transform('scale3d(' + progress + ', '+ progress +', 1)',  this._fxResizeLogo.logo);\n *   },\n *\n *   tearDown: function() {\n *      // clean up and reset of states\n *      delete this._fxResizeLogo;\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n * Now, you can consume the effect:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header id=\"appHeader\" effects=\"resizable-logo\">\n *   <img logo src=\"logo.svg\">\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * ```js\n * var logoEffect = appHeader.createEffect('resizable-logo', effectConfig);\n * // run the effect: logoEffect.run(progress);\n * // tear down the effect: logoEffect.tearDown();\n * ```\n *\n * ### Configuring effects\n *\n * For effects installed via the `effects` property, their configuration can be set\n * via the `effectsConfig` property. For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"\n *   effects-config='{\"waterfall\": {\"startsAt\": 0, \"endsAt\": 0.5}}'>\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * All effects have a `startsAt` and `endsAt` config property. They specify at what\n * point the effect should start and end. This value goes from 0 to 1 inclusive.\n *\n * @polymerBehavior\n */\nPolymer.AppScrollEffectsBehavior = [Polymer.IronScrollTargetBehavior, {\n\n  properties: {\n\n    /**\n     * A space-separated list of the effects names that will be triggered when the user scrolls.\n     * e.g. `waterfall parallax-background` installs the `waterfall` and `parallax-background`.\n     */\n    effects: {\n      type: String\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * An object that configurates the effects installed via the `effects` property. e.g.\n     * ```js\n     *  element.effectsConfig = {\n     *   \"blend-background\": {\n     *     \"startsAt\": 0.5\n     *   }\n     * };\n     * ```\n     * Every effect has at least two config properties: `startsAt` and `endsAt`.\n     * These properties indicate when the event should start and end respectively\n     * and relative to the overall element progress.

It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety\n  of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n   See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n   ### Closing and canceling\n   An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user\n  intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,\n  it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is\n  configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.\n  `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control\n  in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'\n  event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.\n   ### Positioning\n   By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can\n  position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n   ### Backdrop\n   Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is\n  appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling\n  options.\n   In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.\n  Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)\n  to achieve a different behavior.\n   ### Limitations\n   The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You\n  must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking\n  context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.\n   @demo demo/index.html\n  @polymerBehavior\n  */\n  Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior = [Polymer.IronFitBehavior, Polymer.IronResizableBehavior, Polymer.IronOverlayBehaviorImpl];\n\n  /**\n   * Fired after the overlay opens.\n   * @event iron-overlay-opened\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the overlay is canceled, but before it is closed.\n   * @event iron-overlay-canceled\n   * @param {Event} event The closing of the overlay can be prevented\n   * by calling `event.preventDefault()`.

If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed.

Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like.

node in the traversal, and calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *         // @return\n *         //   undefined: no action\n *         //

leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of\n * visitor API:\n

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted.

For example:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   *  <link rel=\"import\" href=\"/bower_components/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/effects/waterfall.html\">\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Consuming effects\n   *\n   * Effects can be consumed via the `effects` property. For example:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"></app-header>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Creating scroll effects\n   *\n   * You may want to create a custom scroll effect if you need to modify the CSS of an element\n   * based on the scroll position.\n   *\n   * A scroll effect definition is an object with `setUp()`, `tearDown()` and `run()` functions.\n   *\n   * To register the effect, you can use `Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect(effectName, effectDef)`\n   * For example, let's define an effect that resizes the header's logo:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect('resizable-logo', {\n   *   setUp: function(config) {\n   *     // the effect's config is passed to the setUp.\n   *     this._fxResizeLogo = { logo: Polymer.dom(this).querySelector('[logo]') };\n   *   },\n   *\n   *   run: function(progress) {\n   *      // the progress of the effect\n   *      this.transform('scale3d(' + progress + ', '+ progress +', 1)',  this._fxResizeLogo.logo);\n   *   },\n   *\n   *   tearDown: function() {\n   *      // clean up and reset of states\n   *      delete this._fxResizeLogo;\n   *   }\n   * });\n   * ```\n   * Now, you can consume the effect:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <app-header id=\"appHeader\" effects=\"resizable-logo\">\n   *   <img logo src=\"logo.svg\">\n   * </app-header>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Imperative API\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * var logoEffect = appHeader.createEffect('resizable-logo', effectConfig);\n   * // run the effect: logoEffect.run(progress);\n   * // tear down the effect: logoEffect.tearDown();\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Configuring effects\n   *\n   * For effects installed via the `effects` property, their configuration can be set\n   * via the `effectsConfig` property. For example:\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"\n   *   effects-config='{\"waterfall\": {\"startsAt\": 0, \"endsAt\": 0.5}}'>\n   * </app-header>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * All effects have a `startsAt` and `endsAt` config property.

It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety\n  of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n\n  See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n\n  ### Closing and canceling\n\n  An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user\n  intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,\n  it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is\n  configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.\n  `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control\n  in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'\n  event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.\n\n  ### Positioning\n\n  By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can\n  position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n\n  ### Backdrop\n\n  Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is\n  appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling\n  options.\n\n  In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.\n  Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)\n  to achieve a different behavior.\n\n  ### Limitations\n\n  The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You\n  must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking\n  context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.\n\n  @demo demo/index.html\n  @polymerBehavior\n  */\n  Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior = [Polymer.IronFitBehavior, Polymer.IronResizableBehavior, Polymer.IronOverlayBehaviorImpl];\n\n  /**\n   * Fired after the overlay opens.\n   * @event iron-overlay-opened\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the overlay is canceled, but before it is closed.\n   * @event iron-overlay-canceled\n   * @param {Event} event The closing of the overlay can be prevented\n   * by calling `event.preventDefault()`.
